I used a pokemon theme for this site. I used d-none and d-md-flex to make the contact us button disappear on smaller screens. I also used the same class to make the register button appear on all screens. I used a pokemon theme for this site. 
I used d-none and d-md-flex to make the contact us button disappear on smaller screens.

The contact us button redirects the user to the contact page.
The register button at the bottom takes the user to the the register form. 
Photo wise, I like the rounded images for the about us section with the abilities of each pokemon.
On the contact form, I used the rounded attribute and w-100 to make the bottom photo strech across the box.
The top photo, I used w-100 to make it strecth across the box.
Of course, my navbar collapses when the screen size gets small. It collapses into a functional hamburger menu.
The website header "Pokemon Team" links to the home page.
The navbar was a challenge at first but I got it. I had to figure out the proper format to make it sticky.
